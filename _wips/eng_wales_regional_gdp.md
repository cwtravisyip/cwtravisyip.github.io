![Latest Quarter GDP (Value-Added) by Industry](/images/porfolio_of_work/regional_gdp_02.png)
Preliminary analysis

Data from the GDP index published by the ONS shows that [London's economy has fared better compared to the rest of England and Wales in the recovery from COVID-19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ype43hG6lN8&t=620s). This is consistent with the general report on the regional disparities in economic development seen across the country. While it is generally understood that the servicing sector contributes to a higher share of the economy in the region, the latest quarterly figure also shows that London is the only region where the construction sector contributes a higher share to the regional GDP compared to the production industry as a whole.

In order to dissect the data to see which industry contributes to the highest share of growth, we need to consider their individual growth rate and their value-added to the economy relative to the growth of the economy. Consider the weighted growth rate by industry in each region, London's growth in GDP is solely due to the expansion of the servicing sector. While the manufacturing industry saw over 10% decrease in the its value-added to London's economy, it's effect on the aggregate economy in London barely registered. 

A cautionary note, however, the real GDP estimate here is computed using the national GDP deflator. Assuming the consumer price index changes are homogenous across the geographical region, this is a valid conclusion. Yet, whether London's prices increased the same compared to the rest of England and Wales is to be determined.
