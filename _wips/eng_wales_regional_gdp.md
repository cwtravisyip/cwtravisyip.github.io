![Latest Quarter GDP (Value-Added) by Industry](/images/porfolio_of_work/regional_gdp_01.png)
Preliminary analysis
Using the GDP index provided by the ONS, it shows that the London's eocnomy has fared better compared to the rest of England and Wales in the recovery from COVID-19. While it is generally understand that the servicing sector contribute to a higher share of the economy in the region, the latest quarterly figure also shows that London is the only region where the construction sector contributes a higher share to the regional GDP compared to the production industry as a whole.

In order to dissect the the data to see which industry contribute to the highest share of growth, we need to consider their individual growth rate and their value-added to the economy relative to the growth of the economy.

A cautionary note, however, the real GDP estimate here is computed using the national GDP deflator. Assuming the the consumer price index changes is homogenous across the geographical region, this is a valida conclusion. Yet, whether London's prices increased the same compared to the rest of England and Wales is to be determined.
