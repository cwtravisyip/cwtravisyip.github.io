In preparation for my dissertation, I have been looking at the public data available in the UK. Namely, I have been exploring the variables available for public access using the [ONS API](https://developer.ons.gov.uk/). Above is an interactive graph showing the percentage of population who has a long commute (>20km) in relation to the percentage of population employed to the service sector.

Some datapoints (Low Tier Local Authority) have been omitted from the data visualisation due to the constraint of the ONS API.*</span>
