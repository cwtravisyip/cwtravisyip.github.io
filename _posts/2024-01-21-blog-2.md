![Hong Kong Style French Toast and Pork Chop over Saucy Noodles](/images/blog/20240121.png)

This weekend, I went to HoKo in Shoreditch. It was the first time I visited a Hong Kong-style diner since moving out of the city. I was not particularly excited about it though I had to admit. If you've ever been to a Hong Kong diner, you would know that pressure on you the moment you step into the diner and the staff  "attending" to you. It is not a place for catching up over a Saturday brunch. Nestled in the hipster hotspot of Shoreditch, I was also not sure if it was going to be an authentic experience.

To my surprise, they didn't offer an extensive choice on their menu as most diners back home would. Instead, there were only 4 options for the mains. All three of us ended up getting the same fried pork chop for the mains and shared a Hong Kong-style French toast with a small side of fried tofu. I do have to say I was impressed by the food. The pork cutlet was pretty crispy. The sauce mixed into the noodles has a good balance of flavour. I have nothing to complain about. The food was prepared as if I were back home.

But that's really bout it. Somehow, being away from home for over 4 months now, I never really had a strong urge to go to a dim sum place for siu mais. I wonder if this is genuinely because I don't have that craving and I'm not ready to splurge and risk getting disappointed.
