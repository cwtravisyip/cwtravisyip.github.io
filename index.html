			Welcome to my page! I am Travis. I am a data enthusiast with experience in coding with Python to create both static and interactive visualisation. 
			I seek opportunities to apply my data science skills to make data accessible and transparent to enable evidence-based decision making.
			I am currently a data management professional at Bloomberg, focusing on the commodity market.
			Previously, I worked as a data scientist in the aviation industry.
			I am experienced in geospatial data, machine learning operations and data pipeline management.

			This webpage began as part of my 2024 New Year resolution. 
			Over time, I plan to share new data stories on the <a href="/portfolio/index.html">portfolio</a> page,
			developed using tools I prototyped and published on my <a href="https://github.com/cwtravisyip">GitHub repository</a>.
			In addition to new projects, I also showcase selected work from my studies.
