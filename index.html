			This webpage is developed as part of my 2024 New Year resolution. 
			Over the year, I will be aiming to post new data stories on the <a href="/portfolio/index.html">portfolio</a> page regularly to hone my skills
			and share my knowledge. 
			While some of the content would be new, some are of my previous work. 
			These include work from school and other work experiences.
