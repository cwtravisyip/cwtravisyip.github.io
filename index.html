		<p>
			Welcome to my page! I am Travis. I am passionate about data storytelling. 
			I currently study at the London School of Economics and Political Sciences, 
			pursuing a Master’s degree in Geographic Data Science. 
			I specialise in the applied machine learning methods for quantitative research in the field of social sciences. 
			I graduated from HKU in 2023, holding a First Class Honours for the Bachelor’s degree in Global Health and Development,
			with a focus on Development Economics.
			For details, navigate to the <a href="/resume/index.html">resume</a> page.

		<p>
			This webpage is developed as part of my 2024 New Year resolution. 
			Over the year, I will be aiming to post new data stories on the <a href="/portfolio/index.html">portfolio</a> page every month as a way to hone my skills. 
			While some of the content would be new, some are of my previous work. 
			These include work from school and other work experiences.
