<p>Every year, this puzzles me. I was rarely a systematic person. The only list I can count myself on is the grocery list I make. Even that, it’s usually a scribble of food categories that I needed rather than a specific food item. It would be “fruit” rather than apples; “Protein” instead of chicken or pork chop.</p>

<p>I have been struggling to make any progress in terms of my careers journey. Ever since I completed my last internship a year ago, I felt that I was prepared for a data job but I never come close to getting an interview. And next thing I know, I found myself in London, back to the city that I saw myself living in, hoping that the University environment and the course I enrolled into would be good stepping stones working towards that goal. I started off strong, taking advantage of the resources and the advisory careers centre. But soon, I found myself getting bogged down again, never coming close to any job, not even a part-time job that gives me extra earning to enjoy what London has to offer.</p>

<p>And so this year, I threw this massive goal of: get a data job. This is defintely a big jump, of course. So I had to break it down into different SMART goals (Thank You AIESEC for teaching me that). This is also in part, thanks to a conversation that I had with a dear friend who told me about her goals for the year. (Thanks Anj:) This site that you are reading my blog post right now is part of the result. I made a vow to myself, that I will discover a data story once a month, twice if possible, and publish it. I have been doing something similar in the past, going back to previous I did for my Bachelor’s and publishing parts of them onto GitHub. However, I never set myself up to a routine of creating something new. Hence, I decided to start afresh and create this website as a way to hold myself accountable.</p>

<p>And hopefully, this will somehow pay off and get me close to landing a data job in the coming year.</p>
