<p>This weekend, I went to HoKo in Shoreditch. It was the first time I visited a Hong Kong-style diner since moving out of the city. I was not particularly excited about it though I had to admit. If you’ve ever been to a Hong Kong diner, you would know that pressure on you the moment you step into the diner and the staff  “attending” to you. It is not a place for catching up over a Saturday brunch. Nestled in the hipster hotspot of Shoreditch, I was also not sure if it was going to be an authentic experience.</p>

<p>To my surprise, they didn’t offer an extensive choice on their menu as most diners back home would. Instead, there were only 4 options for the mains. All three of us ended up getting the same fried pork chop for the mains and shared a Hong Kong-style French toast with a small side of fried tofu. I do have to say I was impressed by the food. The pork cutlet was pretty crispy. The sauce mixed into the noodles has a good balance of flavour. I have nothing to complain about. The food was prepared as if I were back home.</p>

<p>But that’s really bout it. Somehow, being away from home for over 4 months now, I never really had a strong urge to go to a dim sum place for siu mais. I wonder if this is genuinely because I don’t have that craving and I’m not ready to splurge and risk getting disappointed.</p>
