The UK last reported on its implementation to the SDG in 2019. Since then, a lot has changed in its priorities. 
We will have a look at the SDG of focus in 2024, including goal 1 (Zero poverty), Goal 2 (No Hunger), Goal 13 (Climate Action), Goal 16

Goal 1. End poverty in all its forms everywhere; Goal 2. End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture; Goal 13. Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts; Goal 16. Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels; and Goal 17
